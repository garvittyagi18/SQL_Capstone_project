## **Project: Hospital Patient Management System**

### **Purpose**

Design and implement a **database system** for a **Hospital Patient
Management System (HPMS)** to efficiently manage patient records,
appointments, treatments, billing, and staff operations. This system
will replace **manual paperwork and outdated digital records**, ensuring
**real-time access, accuracy, and security of medical data**.

### **Description**

A hospital deals with a **large volume of patients, doctors, nurses,
medical records, and billing transactions** every day. The hospital
management faces challenges such as **appointment scheduling conflicts,
incorrect billing, misplaced patient records, and inefficient resource
allocation**.

The **new database system** will allow:

- Patients to **book appointments** online or through hospital
  reception.

- Doctors to **view patient history, prescribe medications, and update
  treatment records**.

- Admins to **manage hospital staff, departments, and room
  allocations**.

- Automatic tracking of **medical test results, diagnoses, and
  prescriptions**.

- **Secure and real-time billing** for consultations, treatments, and
  surgeries.

- **Automated alerts for critical medical conditions**, medication
  schedules, and appointment reminders.

- **Data security and confidentiality** to protect patient information.

The system must handle **high-volume data transactions** efficiently,
ensuring **zero data loss, no duplicate records, and accurate financial
transactions**.
